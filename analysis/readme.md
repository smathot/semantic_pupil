# Analysis recipe

First, parse the ratings data by running:

	python3 analyze-ratings.py

This will create a file called `ratings.csv`, which is used for the main analyses.

Next, run the full analysis:

	python3 analyze-pupil.py

Notes:

- *térébrant* was misspelled and therefore removed from the analysis.
- *pénombre* occurred twice in the stimulus list of the pupillometry experiment.
