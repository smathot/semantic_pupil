Words were presented for 3 s, or until participants pressed a key. There were four word categories: brightness-conveying, darkness-conveying, neutral, or animal names. Participants (*N*=30) pressed a key when they saw an animal name, and did nothing otherwise. Trials on which participants gave an incorrect response were discarded (0.36%). The average response time to animal words was 792 ms (SE=8.2). No participants or (correct) trials were excluded from the analysis.

The main results are shown in %FigMainResults, in which pupil size is plotted over time since word onset, separately for brightness-conveying, darkness-conveying, and neutral words. (Animal names are not shown, because the pupillary response is distorted by participants' key-press responses.) As predicted, the pupil was smaller when participants read brightness- compared to darkness-conveying words (statistics described below). This effect arose gradually and slowly, and peaked between 1.5 and 2 s after word onset. For neutral words, which did not convey a specific sense of brightness, pupil size was intermediate.

In addition to the effect of semantic brightness, there was a pronounced pupillary dilation that peaked around 0.6 s after word onset. This an alerting effect, or orienting response [@WangMunoz2015], caused by the appearance of the word; this early pupillary response was not clearly modulated by the semantic brightness of the words.

  Pupil size over time, as a function of whether a brightness-conveying, darkness-conveying, or neutral word was presented. Error bands are standard errors. Significance thresholds are based on the contrast between brightness- and darkness-conveying words (see main text for details). The vertical dotted line indicates the mean response time to animal words.

Pupil size is reported relative to pupil size at word onset, and smoothed with a 51 ms hanning window. Only brightness- and darkness-conveying words were carefully matched (see Methods), and therefore only these two categories were included in statistical tests. (However, including all words yields similar results; see Supplementary Materials.) For each 10 ms window, we conducted a linear-mixed effects model (with the R packages `lme4` and `lmerTest`) with pupil size as dependent variable, semantic brightness (bright or dark) as fixed effect, and random by-participant and by-item intercepts and slopes [i.e. maximum random effects, cf @Barr2013]. We commonly use a significance threshold of at least 200 contiguous milliseconds where p < .05 [@Mathôt2013Plos]; with this criterion, the effect is reliable between 1600 and 2020 ms. However, for visualization, we have annotated %FigMainResults with three alpha thresholds (p < .05, p < .01, p < .005) and no minimum number of contiguous samples.

To test how general the effect is, we also looked at mean pupil size during the 1.5 - 2 s window for individual participants and words (%FigIndividualResults). As shown in %FigIndividualResults::a, the majority of the participants showed an effect in the predicted direction, and this effect was strongly supported by a default Bayesian one-sided, one-sample t-test (Bf=14.6 in support of a positive effect; for reference, a classic one-sided, one-sample t-test: t(29)=3.0, p=.003; using JASP [@Love2015]). As shown in %FigIndividualResults::b, the effect of semantic brightness was small relative to the variability between words; however, there was a clear shift in the distribution of pupil sizes, so that pupil size was slightly larger for darkness- than brightness-conveying words, which was again strongly supported by a default Bayesian one-sided, independent-samples t-test (Bf=10.7 in support of larger pupils for darkness- than brightness-conveying words; for reference, a classic one-sided, independent-samples t-test: t(64)=2.7, p=.004). Robustness checks revealed that neither of these effects was dependent on the selected window, or, in the case of Bayes factors, the Cauchy-prior width (i.e. the range of effect sizes that are considered plausible; see Supplementary Materials).

To test whether the effect of semantic brightness could be due to differences in valence or emotional intensity, we collected subjective ratings for the semantic brightness, valence (positive/ negative), and emotional intensity of all stimuli (see Methods for details). First, we found a weak but reliable correlation between brightness and intensity (r=.22, p=.027), such that bright stimuli were rated more emotionally intense than dark stimuli; this would drive an effect in the opposite direction from what we observed, because emotionally intense stimuli (bright words in our case) trigger a strong pupillary dilation [e.g. @Goldwater1972]. In addition, semantic brightness was a much better predictor of pupil size than emotional intensity (see Supplementary Materials). Second, we found a strong and reliable correlation between brightness and valence (r=.89, p<.001), such that bright stimuli were rated more positive than dark stimuli. However, valence probably has no effect on pupil size beyond that of emotional intensity; that is, the pupil dilates as much to negative as to positive stimuli if they are of equal emotional intensity [@Collins1967]; or, according to some (largely discredited) reports, negative emotions (dark words in our case) cause a pupillary constriction [@Hess1965], which should again drive an effect in the opposite direction from what we observed. In addition, semantic brightness was a somewhat better predictor of pupil size than valence (see Supplementary Materials), suggesting that valence predicts pupil size through its correlation with semantic brightness, rather than vice versa. In summary, it is theoretically and statistically unlikely that the effect of semantic brightness on pupil size is driven by differences in valence and emotional intensity of our stimuli.
