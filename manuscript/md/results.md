Words were presented for 3 s, or until participants pressed a key. There were four word categories: brightness-conveying, darkness-conveying, neutral, or animal names. Participants (N=30) pressed a key when they saw an animal name, and did nothing otherwise. Trials on which participants gave an incorrect response were discarded (0.36%). No participants or other trials were excluded from the analysis.

The main results are shown in %FigMainResults, in which pupil size is plotted over time since word onset, separately for brightness-conveying, darkness-conveying, and neutral words. (Animal names are not shown, because the pupillary response is distorted by participants' key-press responses.) As predicted, the pupil was smaller when participants read brightness- compared to darkness-conveying words (statistics are described below). This effect arose relatively late, and peaked between 1.5 and 2 s after word onset. For neutral words, which did not convey a specific sense of brightness, pupil size was intermediate; however, only brightness- and darkness-conveying words were carefully matched (see Methods), and neutral words and animal names were therefore not included in statistical tests.

  Main results. Pupil size over time, as a function of whether a brightness- or darkness-conveying word was presented. Error bands are standard errors. Significance thresholds are based on the contrast between brightness- and darkness-conveying words (see main text for details).

Pupil size is reported relative to pupil size at word onset, and smoothed with a 51 ms hanning window. For each 10 ms window, we conducted a linear-mixed effects model (with the R packages `lme4` and `lmerTest`) with pupil size as dependent variable, semantic brightness (bright or dark) as fixed effect, and random by-participant and by-item intercepts and slopes [i.e. maximum random effects, cf @Barr2013]. We commonly use a significance threshold of at least 200 contiguous ms where p < .05 or t > 2 [e.g. @MathôtMelmiCastet2015;@Mathôt2013Plos], in which case the effect is reliable between 1600 and 2020 ms; however, for visualization, we have annotated %FigMainResults with three alpha thresholds (p < .05, p < .01, p < .005) and no minimum number of contiguous samples.

In addition to the effect of brightness, there was a pronounced pupillary dilation that peaked around 0.6 s after word onset. This an alerting effect, or orienting response [@WangMunoz2015], caused by the appearance of the word; this early pupillary response was not clearly modulated by the semantic brightness of the words.

To test whether the effect of semantic brightness could by differences in valence or emotional intensity, we collected subjective ratings for the semantic brightness, valence (positive/ negative), and emotional intensity of all stimuli (see Methods for details). First, we found a weak but reliable correlation between brightness and intensity (r=.22, p=.027), such that bright stimuli were rated more emotionally intense than dark stimuli; this would drive an effect in the opposite direction from what we observed, because emotionally intense stimuli (bright words in our case) trigger a strong pupillary dilation [e.g. @Goldwater1972]. In addition, semantic brightness was a much better predictor of pupil size than emotional intensity (see Supplementary Materials). Second, we found a strong and reliable correlation between brightness and valence (r=.89, p<.001), such that bright stimuli were rated more positive than dark stimuli. However, valence seems to have no effect on pupil size beyond that of emotional intensity; that is, the pupil dilates as much to negative as positive stimuli if they are of equal emotional intensity [@Collins1967]; or, according to some (largely discreted) reports, negative emotions (dark words in our case) cause a pupillary constriction [@Hess1965], which should again drive an effect in the opposite direction from what we observed. In addition, semantic brightness was a somewhat better predictor of pupil size than valence (see Supplementary Materials), suggesting that valence predicts pupil size through its correlation with semantic brightness, rather than vice versa. In summary, it is theoretically and statistically unlikely that the effect of semantic brightness on pupil size is driven by differences in valence and emotional intensity of our stimuli.
