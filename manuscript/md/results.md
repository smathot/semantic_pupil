Trials were discarded when participants gave an incorrect response (false alarms and misses; visual experiment: 0.36%; auditory experiment: 0.44%), and when pupil-size recordings contained artifacts (trials in which pupil size was less than 0.5 or more than 2.5 times baseline were excluded, because this generally corresponded to unreconstructed blinks or signal loss; visual experiment: 10.1%; auditory experiment: 4.5%). The average response time to animal words was 790 ms (SE=8.6) for the visual experiment, and 1067 ms (SE=12.5) for the auditory experiment. No participants were excluded from the analysis.

## Pupil-size results

The main results are shown in %FigMainResults, in which pupil size is plotted over time from word onset, separately for brightness-conveying, darkness-conveying, and neutral words. (Animal names are not shown, because the pupillary response is distorted by participants' key-press responses.) As predicted, the pupil was smaller when participants read or heard brightness- compared to darkness-conveying words (statistics described below). This effect was present for both visually presented (%FigMainResults::a) and spoken (%FigMainResults::b) words. The effect arose gradually and slowly, and peaked between 1 and 2 s after word onset. For neutral words, which did not convey a specific sense of brightness, pupil size was intermediate.

In addition to the effect of semantic brightness, in the visual experiment there was a pronounced pupillary dilation that peaked around 0.6 s after word onset (%FigMainResults::a). This is an alerting effect, or orienting response [@WangMunoz2015;@Mathôt2014]. This early pupillary response was not clearly modulated by the semantic brightness of the words, and was followed by a pronounced constriction, which always follows visual changes [e.g. @Mathôt2015Intra]. In the auditory experiment, there was no visual stimulation to trigger pupillary constriction, and the pupil therefore dilated throughout the trial, with no clear distinction between the early orientation response and later dilation due to task-related effort.

Error bands are standard errors. Significance thresholds are based on the contrast between brightness- and darkness-conveying words (see main text for details).

Pupil size is reported relative to pupil size at word onset, and smoothed with a 51 ms hanning window. Blinks were reconstructed with cubic-spline interpolation [@Mathôt2013Blinks]. Only brightness- and darkness-conveying words were carefully matched (see Methods), and therefore only these two categories were included in statistical tests. (However, including all words yields similar results; see Supplementary Information.) For each 10 ms window, we conducted a linear-mixed effects model (with the R package `lme4`) with pupil size as dependent variable, semantic brightness (bright or dark) as fixed effect, and random by-participant and by-item intercepts and slopes. We commonly use a significance threshold of at least 200 contiguous milliseconds where p < .05 [@Mathôt2013Plos]; with this criterion, the effect is reliable from 1310 to 2410 ms and 2440 - 2760 ms in the visual experiment, and from 1030 to 1360 ms in the auditory experiment. However, for visualization, we have annotated %FigMainResults with three alpha thresholds (p < .05, p < .01, p < .005) and no minimum number of contiguous samples.

To test how general the effect is, we also looked at mean pupil size during the 1 - 2 s window for individual participants and words (%FigIndividualResults). As shown in %FigIndividualResults::a,b, the majority of the participants showed an effect in the predicted direction, and this effect was supported by a default Bayesian one-sided, one-sample t-test [with JASP [@Love2015]; visual experiment: Bf=51.3; auditory experiment: Bf=4.1; combined Bf=211.1, or 'decisive evidence' in support of a positive effect]. As shown in %FigIndividualResults::b,c, the effect of semantic brightness was small relative to the variability between words; however, there was a clear shift in the distribution of pupil sizes, so that pupil size was slightly larger for darkness- than brightness-conveying words, which was again supported by a default Bayesian one-sided, independent-samples t-test (visual experiment: Bf=6.7; auditory experiment: Bf=3.8; combined Bf=25.4, or 'strong evidence' in support of larger pupils for darkness- than brightness-conveying words). The results were similar when analyzing the full 3 s of the trial, rather than the 1 - 2 s window (see Supplementary Information).

## Normative ratings

To test whether the effect of semantic brightness could be due to differences in valence or emotional intensity, we analyzed the subjective ratings for the semantic brightness, valence (positive/ negative), and emotional intensity of all words.

First, we found a weak but reliable correlation between brightness and emotional intensity (r=.22, p=.027), such that bright words were rated more emotionally intense than dark words; this would drive an effect in the opposite direction from what we observed, because emotionally intense stimuli (bright words in our case) trigger a strong pupillary dilation [e.g. @Goldwater1972]. In addition, semantic brightness was a much better predictor of pupil size than emotional intensity (see Supplementary Information).

Second, we found a strong and reliable correlation between brightness and valence (r=.89, p<.001), such that bright words were rated more positive than dark words; this strong, general association between brightness and positivity needs to be recognized in all studies, including ours, that investigate cognitive effects on the pupillary light response. However, valence probably has no effect on pupil size beyond that of emotional intensity; that is, the pupil dilates as much to negative as to positive stimuli if they are of equal emotional intensity [@Collins1967]; or, according to some reports, negative stimuli (dark words in our case) cause a pupillary constriction [@Hess1965;@Naber2012], which should again drive an effect in the opposite direction from what we observed.

In summary, it is theoretically and statistically unlikely that the effect of semantic brightness on pupil size is driven by differences in valence and emotional intensity of our stimuli. If anything, the fact that the bright words were rated as more emotionally intense than the dark words suggests that our results slightly underestimate the effect of semantic brightness on pupil size (because the effect might be counteracted by an effect of emotional intensity).
