Most researchers agree that language is neither fully embodied, nor fully disembodied; however, a wide variety of intermediate views are consistent with the available evidence. Therefore, we need new methods to address specific, well-defined questions about how (rather than merely whether, or how strongly) language is embodied. Here we present one such method, based on the pupillary light response. An important advantage of this new method is that it allows us to probe not only whether, but also when, sensory representations emerge during reading of individual words. Our results shed important new light on whether sensory representations are a necessary part of word comprehension.
