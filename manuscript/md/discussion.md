Here we report that the eye's pupils constrict after reading brightness-conveying words (e.g. 'sun') compared to darkness-conveying words (e.g. 'night'). This effect arises slowly and gradually, and, in our experiment, peaked between 1.5 and 2 s after word onset.

Our findings have important implications for theories of embodied language. Our starting premise is that an indirect (i.e. without direct visual stimulation) pupillary light response reflects sensory representations that are similar to those that arise during perception [@Laeng2014Imaginary], and presumably involving visual brain areas [@Mathôt2014]. Our findings therefore suggest that word comprehension induces sensory representations and activity in visual brain areas. This is in line with a strongly embodied view of language, which holds that language processing involves sensory (and motor) areas of the brain [@Pulvermüller2013;@GlenberGallese2012]. However, we also found that the pupillary effect arose late, and peaked only around a second after participants had processed the word's meaning and responded to it. This strongly suggests that sensory representations, at least those of the kind that the pupil is sensitive to, are not necessary for word comprehension: The pupil responds to the semantic brightness of words that are understood, but this pupillary response is not part of word comprehension itself [@MahonCaramazza2008].

Is it possible that, in our experiment, word comprehension did rapidly trigger activity in visual brain areas, but that the pupil simply responded very slowly to these? This is unlikely, if you compare the present results to those from an attentional-capture experiment that we conducted previously [@Mathôt2014]. In this experiment, attention was covertly (without eye movements) captured toward a bright or dark background. The effects of attentional capture on neural activity are quasi immediate, with salient stimuli triggering strong responses within 100 ms after their appearance [@Arcizet2011], which modulates neural responses to stimuli presented immediately after [@FecteauMunoz2005]; the effects of attentional capture on pupil size are slower, but nevertheless arise within 500 ms. More specifically, attentional capture toward brightness or darkness modulates the initial pupillary dilation that we also observed in the present experiment, and which was not modulated by semantic brightness (the peak around .6 s in %FigMainResults). Phrased differently, reading a brightness-conveying word affects pupil size far more slowly than a reflexive shift of attention toward a bright surface.

Does this mean that sensory representations are merely by-products of word comprehension, without any function? Not necessarily: While we consider it unlikely that, at least in our experiments, sensory representations of brightness and darkness were necessary for participants to understand the brightness- and darkness-conveying words, sensory representations may be useful for preparation. When you hear the name of an object that is in your field of view, you are likely to look at it [@Cooper1974]; therefore, the pupillary constriction that is triggered by reading the word 'sun' may reflect preparation for looking at the sun [@Mathôt2015EyePrep]. (Which is of course best avoided altogether, but, when done, is done best with a constricted pupil.) In this view, sensory (and motor) representations that arise during word comprehension are not part of the comprehension process--or at least not only--but are a way to mentally prepare for perceptions (and actions) that will occur in the immediate future.

In summary, we have shown that the pupil constricts when reading brightness- compared to darkness-conveying words. This effect arises too late to be a necessary part of word comprehension; however, it may be part of preparation for the future: When you hear the word 'sun', you prepare to look at it, and this causes your pupils to constrict.
