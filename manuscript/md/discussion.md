Here we report that the eye's pupils constrict after reading or listening to brightness-conveying words (e.g. 'sun') compared to darkness-conveying words (e.g. 'night'). This effect arises slowly and gradually, and, in our experiments, peaked between 1 and 2 s after word onset.

Our findings have important implications for theories of embodied language. Our starting premise is that an indirect (i.e. without direct visual stimulation) pupillary light response reflects sensory representations that are similar to those that arise during perception [@Laeng2014Imaginary], and presumably involve visual brain areas [@Mathôt2014]. Our findings therefore suggest that word comprehension can induce activity in visual brain areas, and even trigger involuntary (pupillary) movement, in a way that corresponds to the word's meaning. This finding is consistent with previous behavioral studies that have shown that word meaning can modulate actions; for example, reading the sentence 'open the drawer', which implies a toward-the-body hand movement, speeds up actual hand movements toward the body [@GlenbergKaschak2002]. However, in previous studies, actions were not triggered by word meaning per se, but imposed by the task and voluntarily performed by the participants [e.g. @Aravena2012;@GlenbergKaschak2002;@ZwaanTaylor2006]. Our findings extend these studies by showing that word meaning is by itself sufficient to trigger a movement that is not imposed by the task, and that is largely beyond voluntary control. This is in line with a strongly embodied view of language, which holds that language processing involves sensory and motor areas of the brain, and automatically triggers simulations of perception and action [@Pulvermüller2013;@GlenberGallese2012].

Is pupillary constriction necessary to understand words that convey a sense of brightness--as a strongly embodied view of language would say? Or is pupillary constriction merely a non-functional by-product of reading brightness-conveying words--as a weakly embodied view would say? Our results do not speak directly to this question, but the time course of the semantic pupillary effect is suggestive: The effect arose late, and in the visual experiment peaked only about a second after participants had processed the word's meaning and responded to it. In our view, it is unlikely that such a slow pupillary response is a necessary component of rapid word comprehension. However, this does not necessarily mean that sensory and motor simulations are merely by-products of word comprehension; more specifically, simulations may play a role in preparation. For example, when you hear the name of an object that is in your field of view, you are very likely to look at it [@Cooper1974]; therefore, the pupillary constriction that is triggered by reading the word 'lamp' may reflect preparation for looking at a lamp [@Mathôt2015EyePrep]. In this view, sensory and motor representations that arise during word comprehension are not (only) part of the comprehension process, but reflect preparation for perceptions and actions that are likely to occur in the immediate future. This view, although merely a conjecture at this point, may provide a useful middle ground between strongly and weakly embodied of views of language, by positing a concrete, but modest, function for embodiment in language.

In summary, we have shown that the pupil constricts when reading or listening to brightness- compared to darkness-conveying words. This suggests that word comprehension is by itself sufficient to activate sensory and motor representations, and can even trigger involuntary (pupillary) movement.
