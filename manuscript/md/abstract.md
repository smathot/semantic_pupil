A strongly embodied view of language holds that, to understand a word, you must simulate associated sensory input (e.g. simulate perception of brightness to understand 'lamp'), and prepare associated actions (e.g. prepare finger movement to understand 'typing'). To test this, we investigated whether and when words elicit physiological responses that are associated with their meaning; specifically, we measured pupillary responses to single words that conveyed a sense of brightness (e.g. 'day') or darkness (e.g. 'night'), or were neutral (e.g. 'house'). Crucially, we found that the pupil was largest for darkness-conveying words, intermediate for neutral words, and smallest for brightness-conveying words; however, this effect peaked long after participants had already understood and responded to the words. These findings suggest that word comprehension activates sensory representations, but that these emerge too late to be a necessary part of the comprehension process itself, even taking into account the latency of the pupillary response. Instead, we suggest that pupillary responses to darkness- and brightness-conveying words--and perhaps embodied language in general--may reflect preparation for the immediate future: When you hear the word 'lamp', you prepare to look at a lamp, and this may cause your pupils to constrict in anticipation.
